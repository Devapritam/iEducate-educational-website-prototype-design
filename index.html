            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Literacy is critical in helping us make sense of our world. From the
                time we wake up to the time we go to sleep, we are constantly making meaning of the world around us.
                Literacy has traditionally been thought of as reading and writing. Although these are essential
                components of literacy, today our understanding of literacy encompasses much more. Alberta Education
                defines literacy as the ability, confidence and willingness to engage with language to acquire,
                construct and communicate meaning in all aspects of daily living. Language is explained as a socially
                and culturally constructed system of communication.
                <br><br>
                Literacy development does not take place in just the Language Arts classroom. It is a shared
                responsibility among all educators. Although specific
                knowledge and skills are taught primarily in Language Arts, every subject area teacher is responsible
                for further developing, strengthening and enhancing literacy. Every subject area has its own unique
                literacy demands. Content area teachers know their subject matter and their programs of study. They are
                aware of the literacy requirements of their subject and understand that it is through literacy that
                meaning is made within their subject area content. Students need to be taught how to read different
                kinds of text, write and express themselves in the formats associated with each subject, and use
                content-specific vocabulary.
                <br><br>
                Literacy development occurs not only in school but in every aspect of
                daily life. We interact with others when we have a conversation. We read maps, advertisements,
                newspapers, recipes, manuals and websites. We analyze and interpret vast amount of media information. We
                write poems, songs, reports, blogs, and emails. Literacy opens the door to the world.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Importance of Education in Science</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We all know that 21st Century is the century of knowledge and
                information. To succeed in this new information based and highly technological society, students need to
                develop their capabilities beyond their in classroom activities.
                <br><br>
                STEM based that is Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics based learning has become the route
                of developing 21st century skills. Science is everywhere in the world around us. Scientific temperament
                is the base for critical thinking, creativity and innovation. Innovation is very much essential for
                economic growth and development.
                <br><br>
                There are lot of hidden talents within the studentsâ€™ community in our country, especially in the rural
                areas who can excel in the field of science and technology. However, most of them lack awareness on STEM
                learning due to non availability of information, motivation, proper guidance and counselling. Moreover,
                there is shortage of reading materials as well as proper library facilities for pursuing science
                education leading to the development of science phobia. They are not able to choose their career in the
                field of science and technology. Thus, there is a need to popularise STEM learning among the students
                community.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The Importance of Coding in Future</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Coding and coding literacy can be argued to be one of the most important
                skills for current and future generations to learn. Many have argued that it should form part of a
                national curriculum on par with a native language, the sciences, and math.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We are surrounded with electronic devices each running uncountable numbers of software that run on code
                of some kind. Our modern world is also heavily reliant on the internet with workforces being required to
                be more and more computer literate with each passing year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                But as software becomes ever more sophisticated, the general public is being further and further
                detached from how they actually work. While they are exhaustively designed and tested to be as intuitive
                to use as possible, how they work is fast becoming something of a kind of magic for all but a select
                few.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                "When [someone] is not code-literate, [they] must accept the devices and software [they] use with
                whatever limitations and agendas their creators have built into them. How many times have you altered
                the content of a lesson or a presentation because you couldn't figure out how to make the technology
                work the way you wanted?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                While this might not bother you on the surface, it could have serious implications in the future. Most
                users are simply trusting the developers that they have only the best intentions when they use their
                products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                For this reason, many educators are now pushing for making at least basic coding literacy a requirement
                for all students.
